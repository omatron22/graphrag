    "reasoning": "Operational risk is severe due to repeated supply chain disruptions, affecting key components and production processes. While there's no direct mention of financial metrics being impacted, potential issues like lost sales or increased costs could arise. Market risk is low as the main issue isn't directly related to competition or demand shifts. Overall risk is high, considering both operational and potential financial impacts."
