    "financial": "Low",
    "operational": "Medium",
    "market": "Medium",
    "overall": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Financial Risk is considered low due to the presence of strong financial management entities with high connections, suggesting stability. Operational Risk is moderate as TechCorp and ManufactureX have high connectivity, but CloudSecure's minimal connections indicate potential inefficiencies or vulnerabilities. Market Risk is assessed as low because key regions like North America and Europe are well-connected, indicating market adaptability. Overall Risk is moderately low considering the balance of stable financials, connected markets, and manageable operational risks."
