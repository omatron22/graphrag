    "financial": "Low",
    "operational": "High",
    "market": "Low",
    "overall": "High",
    "reasoning": "The operational risk is high due to global supply chain disruptions affecting key component availability at ManufactureX, leading to potential production delays and increased costs. The financial risk is low as there is no direct mention of negative financial indicators. The market risk is low since there is no information about competition or customer demand issues. Overall risk is moderate, considering the operational challenges without extreme financial or market impacts."
